# Java ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in Java: the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.  The bug arises from accessing an array element using an index that is out of the valid range for that array.  The solution shows how to correct this by ensuring that the loop index does not exceed the array's boundaries.
